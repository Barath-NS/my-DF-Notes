🧠 Inference

The image is not an original camera photo.

Evidence of manipulation:

Edited multiple times in Adobe Premiere Pro (video editing traces) and later in GIMP.

Metadata history shows multiple “saved” and “created” events.

Embedded file references (.mp4, .png) suggest compositing from other media.

👉 Conclusion: The image has been heavily edited and is unlikely to be an authentic unmodified photo.
